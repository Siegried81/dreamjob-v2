/**
 * Administration (FR-361, FR-362, FR-363, FR-364, IR-101, NFR-701, NFR-702).
 *
 * Six surfaces, in the order an operator needs them: what the AI is
 * configured to do and what that costs, which sources may be used and on what
 * terms, what has actually run, the immutable record of who did what, the
 * server's own log files, and the data the installation is holding about
 * people.
 *
 * Each tab owns its own fetching. That is not laziness: the six draw on
 * unrelated endpoints, the audit trail and the call log are both paginated,
 * and hoisting the loading state would make every tab wait for the slowest.
 * Switching tabs unmounts the previous one, so nothing polls in the
 * background either.
 *
 * The whole screen is administrator-only — every /api/admin route depends on
 * `current_admin` — so a job seeker who reaches this URL is told why rather
 * than being shown six tabs of 403s.
