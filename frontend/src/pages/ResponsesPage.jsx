/**
 * Responses received (extends FR-326; feeds FR-421, FR-422, FR-425).
 *
 * Automatic detection only sees replies that arrive in a mailbox the system
 * can poll. A good share of them do not: a phone call, a LinkedIn message, an
 * ATS portal, or any reply at all when the application went out through
 * Resend, which has no inbox. Those responses are the most informative rows
 * the pipeline has, so this screen exists to type them in - and a hand-entered
 * response then travels exactly the same path as a detected one.
 *
 * Two decisions are deliberate here:
 *
 * - A rejection is recorded with the same weight and the same styling as
 *   every other outcome. It is data, and the segment analysis (FR-425) is
 *   worthless without it.
 * - Where the model's reading of a reply differs from the person's, both are
 *   shown and the correction is one visible control, not a menu. A misread
 *   rejection silently distorts every rate it is counted in (NFR-305).

        A rejection filed as “interest”, or an automatic acknowledgement filed as a real

        size it belongs to. Correcting one here corrects it everywhere. Nothing on this
