 * All user-facing guidance lives here rather than being scattered through the

 * and French), and a screen cannot quietly ship without help because the page
 * shell looks its entry up by route.
 *
 * Structure:
 *   PAGE_HELP[route]  - what a screen is for, how to work through it, and the
 *                       caveats that matter on that screen specifically.
 *   GLOSSARY[term]    - a concept the product invents or uses in a particular
 *                       way. Anything a first-time user could reasonably
 *                       misread belongs here, referenced from fields with

      'Your profile — import your LinkedIn export or your CV, and write a few lines about the job you actually want. That is the only input the search needs.',
      'Opportunities — press "Find my opportunities". Dream Job works out what to search for, picks the sources that fit, collects from them and ranks everything it found. It runs in the background, so you can close the page.',
      'Choose among the opportunities. Open the ranked list, read why each role is there, and tick the ones worth pursuing.',
      'Apply. Dream Job writes a tailored CV, a briefing and a motivation document for each, and an email — all for you to read, edit and send.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Nothing is ever sent on its own. Every message waits for you to approve it.',
      'The search is tunable: the directives, campaigns and sources behind it are under Advanced in the sidebar.',
      'A speculative opening is a role Dream Job thinks a company may need, not one it has advertised. They are labelled everywhere so an email never claims a vacancy exists.',

      'For the one thing to do next, go back to Start here — this screen is the detail behind that guided path.',
      'A blocked stage tells you what it needs — start there instead.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'The same map appears as a strip on each working screen, so you always know where you are.',
      'Counts on each stage are live: opportunities found, contacts validated, applications sent, responses recorded.',
      'The headline counts across the top are links — each opens the screen its number comes from.',

      'Say what actually happened: interest, a request for information, an interview invitation, a rejection, a referral, or an automatic reply.',
      'Paste the text if you have it. It is read for detail — proposed interview times, who to contact instead — but your own reading of the outcome is what counts.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Recording rejections matters as much as recording good news. Both feed the pattern analysis on the “What works” screen.',
      'If a classification is wrong you can correct it. A misread rejection quietly distorts every rate it is counted in.',
      'Recording a response moves the application on the pipeline board automatically.',
      'An application counts as answered or as silence, and nothing in between: until 21 days have passed, silence is not yet evidence. The summary at the top says how many have resolved and how many more the analysis needs.',

      'Read the segment tables: the kind of work, the seniority, the company size and stage, the sector, the arrangement, the country, advertised versus speculative, and the language you wrote in.',
      'Look at the sample size and the width of the plausible range before you look at the percentage. Three applications is not a pattern, and the band drawn behind each rate shows how little a thin segment can carry.',
      'Run the analysis to turn those figures into redirection proposals. Each one names the counts on both sides of the move.',
      'Apply one to create a new version of your directives, or dismiss it with a reason. Everything you decided is kept at the bottom of the screen so you can trace it and revert it.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Applying a proposal never overwrites your directives — it creates a new version you can revert to.',
      'A proposal that conflicts with your dream-job statement is flagged rather than hidden. The data does not get to overrule what you want; it only tells you what it is costing.',
      'Advice needs roughly six resolved applications before it will say anything at all.',
      'Segments marked “thin” are dimmed and excluded from advice: they are shown so you know they exist, not so you can act on them.',
      'The figures are cached to the last stored run, since they only move when a response is recorded. “Recompute” re-reads your responses.',
    ],

      'Upload your CV as PDF or DOCX. Your photo is extracted automatically if the file contains one.',
      'Resolve the conflicts. Where the two documents disagree about a date, title or employer, you are asked which is right. Nothing is silently picked for you, and the answers are written into a new version when you apply them.',
      'Correct the sections. Summary, experience, education, certifications, publications, projects and languages are all editable; anything the parser read with low confidence is flagged for you to check.',
      'Tidy the skills. Matching runs on the normalised label, not the words in your CV, so a mis-normalised skill is invisible rather than merely untidy.',

    tips: [
      'Each save creates a new version, and you can view or restore an older one. Campaigns record which version they used, so an old ranking stays explainable.',
      'Your uploads are kept, so the profile can be re-extracted later without asking you for the files again.',

      'Review each statement on the "Composite profile" tab. Every one carries a source — your input, the LinkedIn export, your CV, or a specific URL. Hover the source marker to see it, and to see the confidence behind a web citation.',
      'Work the "Online findings" queue. Open "Why this was attributed to you" on any finding to see the individual identity signals — name variants, employer overlap, cross-links, location, timeline, photo similarity — each with its own score and the text that matched.',
      'Confirm or reject each one. Only findings that matched your identity with high confidence were merged automatically.',
      'Edit anything that reads wrong. Your edits win over the synthesis, and anything you write is attributed to you rather than to a page.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'A rejected finding is remembered and never proposed again — the button says so because the decision is permanent.',
      'Online enrichment can be switched off entirely on the "Enrichment" tab; the composite profile is then built from your documents alone.',
      'Statements marked "needs confirming" could not be traced to any source. They are kept and flagged rather than quietly presented as fact.',

      'Correct it and confirm. It is used for matching, so a wrong deal-breaker costs you real opportunities.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Say what you want to avoid. Deal-breakers filter more decisively than preferences.',
      'Mention conditions that matter: commute, remote days, team size, autonomy, travel. They become directive defaults.',
      'This is separate from your search directives. Directives bound where the system looks; this describes what would make you happy if it found it.',
      'Rewriting the statement does not update the model. The screen tells you when the two have drifted apart — rebuild before you launch a campaign, because planning and scoring read the model, not your text.',

      'Turn on discretion mode if you are searching while employed, and name your current employer before anything else.',
      'Check the collection estimate beside the form before launching. It tells you how many sources and pages the current settings imply.',
      'Save the set under a name. Saving again after a campaign has used it creates a new version rather than overwriting it.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Directive sets are saved, named, versioned and reusable across campaigns.',
      '"Notes to the AI" is the only free-text field; use it for nuance the controls cannot express. Hard constraints belong in the controls, where a source adapter can actually act on them.',
      'Compensation is used for filtering and scoring only. It is never written into a CV or an email unless you explicitly opt in, and that opt-in is off by default.',
      'A commute tolerance is a tighter statement than a plain radius: set one and your search areas are narrowed to match it.',
      'Ticking "speculative openings only" changes which sources run, so the estimate moves as soon as you set it.',
    ],
    caution:
      'The collection estimate is an order of magnitude derived from your settings, not a promise. Discretion mode excludes companies and contacts by name and domain matching — strong, but it cannot catch a group company trading under an unrelated name unless you name it yourself.',

      'Re-run a single stage when something needs redoing — the plan, the reuse assessment, collection, opportunity synthesis or scoring — instead of repeating the whole campaign.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'The planner checks the shared knowledge base first and only collects what is missing or stale. The saving is reported before you launch.',
      'A crash loses at most the page in flight; jobs resume from their last checkpoint.',
      'The token budget caps AI spend. Near the limit the system degrades gracefully, dropping speculative openings for low-ranked companies first.',

      'Read the terms warning at the top and decide. Nothing starts until you have acknowledged it, and you can withdraw that at any time.',
      'Run scripts/browser.sh, or copy the command for your platform from the launch instructions. It opens a browser with a separate profile, leaving your normal one untouched.',

    tips: [
      'You can watch it work, pause at any moment, and skip individual targets.',
      'It stops immediately if it hits a captcha, challenge or rate-limit page, and says so rather than retrying.',
      'Automation is slow by design — a few seconds per page. Campaigns assume tens to low hundreds of targets, not thousands.',
      'Chromium-family browsers are attached to over the debugging port; Firefox has no such port, so Dream Job re-opens the dedicated profile itself.',
      'The estimate is refined from measurements while the run is going, so the time remaining gets more accurate as it works.',

      'Tick two or three and compare them side by side before you commit.',
      'Then generate applications for everything you ticked, and read them on the Applications screen before anything is sent.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Your manual order overrides the computed ranking and survives recalculation. Positions are numbered within one campaign, so hand-ordering asks you to pick a campaign and stay on the first page.',
      'Rejection reasons feed back into your weights — the ranking learns from them, which is why the reason is required.',
      'The dream-job fit meter is separate from the overall score. It shows which of your criteria the role meets, partly meets and violates.',
      'The tick box is your shortlist and it lives on the server, so it stays correct across filters and pages.',
    ],
    caution:
      'The score is advisory and nothing acts on it. It orders a list; every decision to keep, reject or apply is yours, and a low-ranked role you know something about beats a high-ranked one you do not.',

      'The shared knowledge base of company profiles, five-year financial analyses, competitors and hiring signals — searchable on its own, without picking a campaign.',
    steps: [
      'Search or browse. The full-text index covers the business summary, products and markets, not only the name; country, size band and sector narrow the whole knowledge base, while stage and trajectory narrow the page you are looking at.',
      'Read the freshness mark before you read the figures. A stale row is still shown, because old research beats none, but it describes the company as it was.',
      'Open a company for the standardised profile: identity, what it does, size, locations, the departmental map, key people, reference customers, technology and news, each field carrying the page it was read from.',
      'Work through the financial tab. Five filed years, the revenue and headcount trends, and the two 0–100 scores with the reasoning that cites the figures.',
      'Check the market tab for competitors, dated hiring signals and the application window, and the values tab for anything the company says that contradicts what you want.',
      'Watch the companies worth following, and refresh a profile when it has gone stale.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Company research is shared across job seekers and reused while it stays fresh, so a second search costs nothing rather than re-crawling.',
      'Nothing here links back to any job seeker — the knowledge base holds market data only. Your watchlist and the values comparison are private and sit on top of it.',
      'Estimated years are marked as estimated, and figures that did not reconcile against the filing carry a flag. Both weaken every score computed from them.',
      'Adding a competitor to your list also creates the shared record for it when it has not been profiled yet, so the next campaign can pick it up.',
      'A refresh is a paced crawl of the company\'s own site, roughly a minute for thirty pages. It re-derives signals and competitors from the same pages rather than walking the site twice.',

    steps: [
      'Run "Find contacts for my shortlist" to scrape your target companies: each company’s own site and press pages are read for a named hiring manager or a published careers mailbox, and every address is validated before it is stored. It is a background job because it is rate-limited per domain.',
      'Pick a company to see its ranked contacts: the hiring manager of the relevant department where one can be identified, then talent acquisition, then a generic careers mailbox. "Find contacts for this company" re-runs the ladder for just that one.',
      'Check the validation result. Addresses that came back invalid are never sent to.',
      'Look at the introduction routes before settling for a cold email — a warm introduction does better.',
      'Import your own network once, so routes can be found for every company from then on.',

      'An inferred address — guessed from the pattern of other addresses on the same domain — is marked as such and deserves less confidence than one published on the company site.',
      'A "risky" result usually means a catch-all domain, where the server accepts anything and proves nothing.',
      'Contacts collected through browser automation expire with the campaign that collected them and are never shared.',

So the employer is shown as not disclosed, the company-related parts of the score are left uncomputed rather than estimated, and nothing generated for you ever names a guessed employer.

Separating them is what makes the dozen findable. The rule is worth stating plainly, because the opposite mistake was made here first: a source that fetched nothing used to be recorded as finished with no errors, and that hid a total collection failure.
