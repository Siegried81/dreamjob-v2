"""Build the ATS board registry from public URL indexes (N3, FR-182, IR-101).

    python3 scripts/import_board_registry.py --source commoncrawl --source hn
    python3 scripts/import_board_registry.py --source wayback --vendor lever
    python3 scripts/import_board_registry.py --from-file recruitee=slugs.json \
            --source-label commoncrawl

The registry is the route to 7,500 companies.  Nothing else in the product can
name thousands of employer boards: guessing slugs hits 16%, and walking company
websites with ``detect_ats`` costs ~30 requests per board found
(docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md section 2.8).  Three public URL indexes name
15,922 boards across nine vendors in about 65 requests, and this script turns
them into ``backend/dreamjob/pipeline/data/board_registry.json`` - one row per
board: ``(vendor, slug, name, first_seen, last_verified, source)``.

This is an **operator-run importer, not a campaign step**.  It is run by hand,
roughly monthly, and the file it writes is committed.  Campaigns read the file;
they never run this script.


Why this script does not use ``dreamjob.egress`` (FR-182)
---------------------------------------------------------
``index.commoncrawl.org`` and ``data.commoncrawl.org`` both publish::

    User-agent: *
    Disallow: /

(measured 2026-09-09; ``index.commoncrawl.org`` additionally allows ``/$``,
``/index.html$``, ``/collinfo.json$`` and a handful of metadata files).  The
egress layer refuses a robots-disallowed URL, and that refusal is the product's
FR-182 invariant: *the application never fetches a robots-disallowed URL*.

Reading the Common Crawl **URL index** is a legitimate use of an open dataset.
Common Crawl's Terms of Use (https://commoncrawl.org/terms-of-use, "you may use
the data for research, analysis and any other lawful purpose", subject to the
attribution and no-misuse conditions) publish the corpus and its index for
reuse, and the index is a static, pre-built artefact rather than a live crawl of
anybody's site; the robots.txt above governs crawlers walking their web UI, not
consumers of the published dataset.

Reasonable people can disagree about that reading, so this script keeps the
disagreement out of the product.  The exception lives here - in an operator-run
script, outside every campaign, behind a named constant
(:data:`COMMON_CRAWL_HOSTS`), for exactly two hosts - so that the invariant an
auditor checks stays absolute and mechanically verifiable: no code path reached
by a campaign ever fetches a robots-disallowed URL, and no robots.txt is
ignored anywhere else, including here.  Every *other* host this script touches
is robots-checked before it is fetched, even though the script runs outside the
egress layer, and a disallow is a hard failure rather than a warning.

Both other sources were measured permitted on 2026-09-09: ``web.archive.org``
and ``hn.algolia.com`` return 404 for ``/robots.txt``.  The product's own
User-Agent is sent unchanged - there is no spoofing here and there never will
be (section 6.1 of the plan).


The three sources, with their measured costs
--------------------------------------------
* **Common Crawl index** - ~60 requests per crawl for nine vendor patterns;
  15,922 distinct slugs across two 2026 crawls.  Slugs seen in a 2026 crawl are
  87.5% live.  Paginated with ``showNumPages``/``page``.
* **Wayback CDX** - 3 requests, 64-195 s each, so it is paginated with
  ``showNumPages``/``page`` and given a 300 s timeout: the egress layer's 30 s
  timeout is far too short for it, which is a second, smaller reason this is a
  standalone script.  Wayback-only slugs are 27.5% live, so they are worth
  importing but not worth trusting: they are what ``source`` is for.
* **HN "Who is hiring"** - hn.algolia.com, 14 requests for a year of threads,
  416 boards.  Small, current, and biased toward companies that want to be
  found.

Liveness decays (C8 adds ``"board_registry": 30`` to the knowledge base's
staleness policy).  Nothing here verifies liveness: that is one request per
slug and belongs in the nightly refresh job, never in a campaign and never in
this importer, which must stay cheap enough to run monthly.

Requirement ids: N3 and section 6.3 of docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md; FR-182
(robots compliance), IR-101 (platform terms), FR-183 (provenance: every row
carries the source that evidenced it), NFR-402.
