"""Resumable background jobs (FR-185, NFR-401, NFR-502).

Collection and generation work runs as ``JobRun`` records that can be paused,
resumed and cancelled, and that survive a crash: each worker checkpoints its
position after every unit of work, so a restart loses at most the in-flight
page (NFR-401).

The runner is deliberately in-process and asyncio-based.  Dream Job is a
single-node application over a single SQLite file (CR-408); adding a broker
would buy nothing and would break the "one writer" invariant (NFR-102).

In-process, however, must not mean *on the request loop*.  A job body is
allowed to block: the pipeline writes to SQLite synchronously and
``llm/client.py`` is a synchronous HTTP client with blocking retry sleeps.
Started with ``asyncio.create_task`` on the loop uvicorn serves from, one
collection campaign therefore owned that loop for as long as it ran -- a real
2,686-item campaign held it for eighteen hours, during which a ``SELECT`` on a
unique index over a table of tens of rows was logged at 68,862 ms because the
coroutine that would run it waited that long to be *scheduled*, not to be
answered.

So each job gets a thread from a bounded pool and its own event loop inside
it.  Whatever the worker blocks on -- the database, DeepSeek, ``time.sleep``
in a retry -- it blocks only its own loop, and the API keeps answering.  Both
pools are bounded because the opposite of a starved loop is an exhausted
process, and 2,686 items must not become 2,686 threads queued on the single
writer.  ``tests/unit/test_runner_isolation.py`` measures the loop directly
rather than asserting that this module calls ``to_thread``.

Three things make that arrangement safe rather than merely faster.

**The lane.**  Getting off the loop moves the contention rather than removing
it: a job thread and a request thread now want the same single writer
(CR-408).  Every thread this module owns is put in the ``bulk`` write lane
(``db.connection.set_write_lane``), so a request never queues behind the
thousands of writes a campaign still has to do.  That is the difference
between a campaign slowing the API down and a campaign stopping it.

**Daemon threads.**  Not ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` for the job pool: it registers
an interpreter-exit hook that *joins* its worker threads, so a process asked
to stop during a campaign would wait for the campaign to end.  The incident
this module exists for finished with a SIGKILL because the process would not
go away; a pool that can keep it alive is the wrong tool.  Daemon threads let
the interpreter leave, and NFR-401 makes the job resumable when it returns.

**A measurement.**  While any job runs, a watchdog on the *serving* loop
records how late it is woken.  That number -- not a statement duration -- is
what "the API is dark" looks like from inside the process, and its absence is
why 68,862 ms was read as a missing index (see ``observability/db_logging``).
