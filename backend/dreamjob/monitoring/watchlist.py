"""Watched companies, rechecked on a schedule (FR-401, FR-402).

A watch is a standing instruction: recheck this company every ``n`` days on
four channels - the careers page and its ATS endpoint, the newsroom, the
hiring signals those produce, and new filings - notify the job seeker of
anything new, and put matching vacancies straight into the ranked list.

Design points that matter:

*Channels are independent.*  A company with no newsroom, no ATS and no filed
accounts still gets its careers page read, and a failure on one channel never
stops the others.  Each channel reports what it found and what it could not
reach, and that report is stored on the entry so a silent watch can be told
apart from a broken one.

*New means new since the last look.*  The comparison is against
``last_checked_at``, and the notification carries a ``dedup_key`` so a vacancy
that stays open for six weeks is announced once, not six times.

*Adding to the ranked list is not the same as scoring it.*  A vacancy found
here is synthesised into an opportunity for the campaign the watch names, with
the campaign's own directives applied as a filter (FR-142..145).  It arrives
unscored, and the scorer picks it up on its next pass - which keeps FR-401's
"automatically" honest without letting a background job silently reorder the
seeker's list.

*Timing intelligence rides along* (FR-402): every pass refreshes the company's
hiring signals and recomputes its application window, so a favourable moment
reaches the ranked list as a ``timing_flag`` without a separate job.
