"""Identity matching for online findings (FR-123, FR-124, RK-02).

RK-02 is the risk this module exists to hold down: a homonym's blog post
becoming a line on the job seeker's CV.  The defence is that a name match on
its own can never reach ``confirmed``.  Every finding is scored on several
independent signals, each one recorded separately in
``enrichment_finding.identity_signals`` so the job seeker sees *why* a page was
attributed to them and can overrule it (FR-124).

Signals and weights
-------------------

===================== ======  ==================================================
signal                weight  what it measures
===================== ======  ==================================================
name_match             0.30   the page names the job seeker, in some variant
employer_overlap       0.22   employers from the profile appear on the page
cross_link             0.16   the page *is* or *links to* a URL the job seeker
                              declared themselves
location_match         0.12   cities/countries from the profile appear
timeline_consistency   0.10   years on the page fall inside the career span
photo_similarity       0.10   perceptual hash distance to the profile photo
===================== ======  ==================================================

``conflicting_evidence`` is a negative signal: it fires when the page carries
several profile-shaped anchors (employers, places, years) and *none* of them
overlap with the job seeker.  That is what a homonym looks like.

Classification thresholds
-------------------------

``confirmed``  score >= 0.72 **and** name_match >= 0.5 **and** at least two
               corroborating non-name signals scoring >= 0.4 each **and** no
               conflicting evidence.  A page hosted on a domain the job seeker
               listed themselves is confirmed outright.
``probable``   score >= 0.40 and name_match >= 0.5.
``doubtful``   everything else, including any page where the name itself is
               only a weak match.

Only ``confirmed`` is merged automatically (FR-124); the rest is queued for the
job seeker with the evidence attached.
