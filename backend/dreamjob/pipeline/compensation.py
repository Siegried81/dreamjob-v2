"""Compensation estimation and employer-review signals (FR-264, FR-265).

FR-264 asks for an estimated range with a confidence and a source list.  The
sources are ranked by how defensible they are, and that ranking is the whole
design:

1. **What the employer stated.**  A posted range is not an estimate at all, and
   it is used as-is with the estimate marked ``is_stated``.
2. **Posted ranges on comparable vacancies.**  The campaign has already
   collected a vacancy corpus; those are real offers, dated, attributable to a
   URL, and in the right market.  Nothing else the system can reach is as
   defensible, so this source carries the most weight and is tried at several
   widths - the same function family at the same company, then the same family
   and seniority in-country, the same family in-country, and title terms
   in-country - stopping at the first ones that have enough observations.  Every
   width matches on the role, never on the employer alone.
3. **National salary surveys and Glassdoor/Levels observations**, as far as an
   adapter or the browser slice has collected them into
   ``compensation_observation``.  They are market-wide rather than
   company-specific, so they anchor rather than decide.

   Glassdoor is a second case of the same rank.  What its browser run collects
   is opinion gathered under restrictive terms, so - by the deliberate choice
   documented in :mod:`dreamjob.browser.glassdoor` - it is *not* promoted into
   the shared ``compensation_observation`` base.  It is read back per campaign
   instead, through :func:`campaign_advisory`, and enters an estimate as an
   advisory source with its own low weight.  A Glassdoor page is only ever
   matched to an opportunity on company *and* role: what an employer pays its
   warehouse staff says nothing about what it would pay a data director.
4. **A coarse built-in band prior**, used only when nothing above exists.  It is
   labelled as a prior, not as survey data, and capped at low confidence: it
   says "a director in this family in this country is not paid like a junior",
   and nothing more precise than that (CR-405).

FR-265 adds employer-review signals - rating and review themes.  They are
**advisory input only**: they never move the compensation range and they enter
scoring as a small, separately visible component, because a review average is a
self-selected sample, not a measurement.
