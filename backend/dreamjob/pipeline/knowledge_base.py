"""Shared knowledge base: writer, freshness policy and reuse (FR-341..345).

The knowledge base is the reason a second campaign is cheaper than the first.
Three things live here:

* **The writer** - the single way a collected record enters a shared table.
  It de-duplicates (FR-184), merges rather than overwrites, keeps the FTS
  index in step (FR-345), links the record to the plan item that produced it
  (FR-166) and refuses to store any link back to the job seeker (FR-344).
* **The staleness policy** (FR-343) - per record type, configurable, with the
  specified defaults: vacancies 7 days, company profiles 90 days, filings one
  year.  It is stored in ``app_setting`` so an administrator can change it
  without a deployment.
* **The reuse assessment** (FR-342) - before anything is collected, the plan is
  compared against what the knowledge base already holds fresh, plan items that
  are already satisfied are skipped, and the saving is reported to the user in
  concrete terms: per entity type, how many records were reused rather than
  re-collected, and the collection time and cost that avoided.
