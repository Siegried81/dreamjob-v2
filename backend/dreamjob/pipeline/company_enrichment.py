"""Company enrichment: the passes that make an employer more than a name.

Eleven rungs of company research already existed - the employer-kind ladder,
the website crawl, competitors, hiring signals, the financial filings and the
two financial scores - and **nothing ran them automatically**. A campaign that
collected 43,000 vacancies left every employer in it a bare name: no website
profile, no filings, no signals, no employer kind, and the ranked list showing
"employer type not verified" on every row. The passes were reachable only from
the administration and campaign screens, so they ran when someone remembered
to press them.

This module is the missing scheduler-side orchestrator. It is deliberately
thin: every pass already exists, is bounded and already degrades on its own, so
all that is added here is the order, a shared budget, and one report.

The order matters
-----------------
1. **Employer kind** first. Scoring reads it, the badge shows it on every row,
   and it decides what the product may do with the employer (a recruitment
   agency posting is not the employer's own vacancy).
2. **Website profile** next; it is the source the other passes read.
3. **Competitors and signals** after the crawl, because both read the pages it
   stored.
4. **Financials** last: the most expensive, and the one whose absence still
   leaves a usable record.

Every pass is incremental (FR-226, FR-343): each checks its own staleness
first, so running this on a campaign that is already enriched costs a few
queries rather than a re-crawl.
