"""Loading the Belgian company register into the staged universe (FR-161, FR-341).

Belgium publishes its company register as a monthly open-data bulk extract:
a zip of CSVs, one per aspect of an entity.  That is the lawful, official,
complete answer to "which companies exist", and it is the opposite of the
collection model the rest of the system uses - one download instead of two
million rate-limited lookups, and a population that includes the companies that
have never advertised, which is the only population from which a speculative
opening can be found.

Files read, by their published names:

    enterprise.csv   EnterpriseNumber, Status, JuridicalSituation,
                     TypeOfEnterprise, JuridicalForm, JuridicalFormCAC, StartDate
    denomination.csv EntityNumber, Language, TypeOfDenomination, Denomination
    address.csv      EntityNumber, TypeOfAddress, CountryNL, CountryFR, Zipcode,
                     MunicipalityNL, MunicipalityFR, StreetNL, HouseNumber, ...
    activity.csv     EntityNumber, ActivityGroup, NaceVersion, NaceCode, Classification

The parser is written against those headers rather than their positions, so a
column added by a later extract does not shift everything.

Nothing here promotes a seed into ``company``: staging is cheap and a promotion
is a decision the planner makes (see ``discovery.seed_companies``).  Two million
staged rows are an index; two million company rows would be a liability.
