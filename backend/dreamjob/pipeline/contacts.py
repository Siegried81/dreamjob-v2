"""Hiring-contact discovery (FR-301, FR-306, NFR-302, NFR-303, CR-402, RK-08).

FR-301 fixes the priority order, and the whole module is built around it:

1. **the hiring manager of the relevant department**, where the department can
   actually be identified.  ``company.structure`` (FR-223) is the input: the
   opportunity's function family and title are matched against the business
   units and functions the company profile found, and the unit's ``head`` is
   the candidate.  When no unit matches, there is no hiring manager - guessing
   one from a job title would be an invented fact (CR-405).
2. **an HR or talent-acquisition contact**, recognised from the role title in
   the four languages of the target market.
3. **a generic careers mailbox**, which is what most smaller employers publish
   and is always a lawful route (CR-402, CR-403).

Every candidate carries its tier, role, source and confidence, and the ranked
list is what the interface shows (FR-301).  A candidate is only promoted above
its tier by evidence: a published address outranks an inferred one, and a
``valid`` FR-304 verdict outranks an ``unknown`` one.

Three rules constrain what this module is allowed to keep:

* **FR-306 / RK-08** - name, role, company, professional e-mail, source, date.
  ``repositories.contacts.minimise`` is the gate, and this module never
  assembles anything else in the first place.
* **NFR-303** - anything collected through browser automation is written with
  ``shareable = 0``, the owning campaign, and a deletion date equal to the
  campaign's end plus a grace period.  :func:`sweep_retention` deletes them
  when due and is registered as a job the monitoring scheduler can run.
* **NFR-302** - an objection blocks an address permanently, for every job
  seeker.  It is recorded in ``contact_objection`` and enforced by the
  ``usable_contact`` view, so the generation slice inherits the block through
  its query and not through the interface.
