"""Company domains at scale (FR-301, FR-303, FR-304, FR-305, CR-405, NFR-402).

:mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.apply_contacts` cannot spell an address before it knows
a domain, and 867 of the 1,430 companies that have posted a vacancy carry none:
1,700 vacancies with nothing to apply to, which is the whole distance between
the coverage the Apply Browser shows and the coverage the brief asks for.  The
same gap stops the employer-kind resolver: 499 of its 531 ``cannot_tell``
verdicts are ``no_domain``.  One question blocks both features, so it is asked
once, here, and the answer is written onto the company record where every other
pass already looks for it.

**The ladder, cheapest and most certain first.**

1. ``held_contact`` / ``vacancy_text`` - a domain already implied by data in
   the database: the domain of an address on a contact at this company, or of
   an address the employer itself published in one of its postings.  These cost
   nothing and a person at the employer wrote them, so an address *at the
   employer's own domain* is taken as it stands - exactly as
   :func:`apply_contacts.resolve_domain` takes it.  An address on some other
   domain is not: a posting carries boilerplate as well as its employer, and
   "NATUURWERK VZW" prints ``student@work.be`` - the government's student-jobs
   portal - two lines above ``www.natuurwerk.be``.  Those go to the gate
   (:func:`names_the_company`).
2. ``vacancy_link`` - a bare URL in a posting's own text.  *Not* taken as it
   stands: a posting links partners, press and video as readily as it links the
   employer, so the link only names a candidate and the gate in step 5 decides -
   and for a link the gate is asked the strict question, because a recruiter's
   page about "Stad Oudenaarde" names the city as fluently as the city's own.
3. ``ats_board`` - the board slug on the company record.  Measured on this
   corpus it resolves nothing (eight companies carry a slug and none of them
   lacks a domain), and it is here because it costs one dictionary lookup and
   because the next collection run may fill the column.
4. ``register`` - the Belgian enterprise register's own "Web Address" line,
   read off the enterprise page :mod:`employer_registry_rung` already resolves
   behind its hardened exact-name gate.  Measured over the 391 Belgian
   companies in this pool: the register identified 38 of them strongly enough
   to read a domain off, published a web address for exactly one of those
   (``match-jobs.be`` for "Verzelen Maes Consultants BV"), and that one did not
   survive step 5's gate.  Every page was already in the HTTP cache from the
   employer-kind pass, so the rung costs nothing; it is free rather than
   valuable, and it is kept because the register fills the field over time and
   because a domain the state publishes is better evidence than any spelling.
5. ``derived_confirmed`` - a domain spelled from the company name and then
   **confirmed** against the page it answers with.

**Never invent a domain.**  Step 5 is where a pass like this goes wrong, and it
has gone wrong here before: an earlier gate accepted ``house.com`` for "HOUSE OF
RECRUITMENT SOLUTIONS BV" and ``federale.be`` for a federal ministry, and three
namesake domains had to be deleted from this database.  Two rules keep it
honest, and both are borrowed rather than re-invented:

* the candidate must have a mail exchanger, its home page must answer, and
  :func:`employer_registry_rung.page_identity` - the v2 gate, the same function
  the contact ladder and the re-verification pass judge with - must say the page
  belongs to *this* company;
* a name with fewer than two identifying words gets more, not less.  That is the
  class every namesake in this corpus came from, and 127 of the 473 companies
  with a derived domain are in it.  For those names this module requires the
  gate's ``confirmed`` verdict rather than its ``confirmed``-or-``review``,
  requires the page to show the market itself rather than merely to live on the
  market's top-level domain, and requires a *spelled* candidate to sit on that
  top-level domain at all (:func:`_high_risk`, :func:`_accepts`).  It also never
  spells a *subset* of such a name, so "HOUSE OF RECRUITMENT SOLUTIONS" never
  produces ``recruitment.be``.  The last of those rules was written after this
  pass confirmed ``adequat.eu`` for "Adéquat Belgium NV" - a chestnut fencing
  shop with a Belgian showroom, titled exactly "Adéquat" - which is the fourth
  namesake this corpus has produced and the first one caught before it was
  written down.

A company whose ladder produces nothing is written down as ``unresolved`` with
the reason.  That is a finding, not a failure: it is what stops the next pass
re-deriving the same eight dead spellings, and it is the honest answer.

**What the spellings add over the contact ladder's.**  ``candidate_domains``
tries the tokens run together and the tokens hyphenated.  This module keeps
those and adds three, each aimed at a shape the corpus actually contains: the
German ``ae``/``oe``/``ue``/``ss`` transliteration of a name written with
umlauts ("Rügamer & Steiner" is at ``ruegamer-steiner``, never ``rugamer``); the
name with its thousand-times-repeated words dropped, but **only when two
identifying words survive** ("ISAR Aerospace Technologies" -> ``isaraerospace``,
while "Quality Jobs@work" is left alone because ``quality.be`` is a guess about
whose domain it is); and the first two words of a longer name.  Every one of
them still has to survive the gate.

**FR-305 and CR-402.**  Nothing here fetches by any route but
:class:`~dreamjob.egress.client.EgressClient`, which enforces robots.txt, the
per-domain rate limit and the HTTP cache.  The MX answer is cached by
:func:`email_validate.mx_for` and the per-domain probe verdict by
``apply_domain_probe`` through :mod:`dreamjob.db.repositories.apply` - the same
two caches the contact ladder fills, so a domain judged for one company is not
re-fetched for the next.  What that cache cannot answer is whether a page
belongs to a *particular* company, so a cached ``confirmed`` or ``rejected``
that was recorded against a different company is re-judged rather than reused;
``no_mx`` and ``unreachable`` are about the domain alone and are trusted.

    review because the country could not be reconciled - which
    :attr:`IdentityDecision.confirmed` already treats as good enough to go on
    using, and which the re-verification pass leaves standing.

    For a name with fewer - "Adéquat Belgium NV", "DE BRANDT NV", "Alan", the
    class every namesake in this corpus came from - three things are required
    beyond that.

    1. ``review`` is not enough.  The only evidence such a name has is that the
       page calls itself exactly this, so a page that calls itself something
       longer, or sits somewhere the market cannot be seen, decides nothing.
    Before any of that, a *spelled* candidate has to have answered with a page
    that carries text at all: see the ``konverthr.com`` note below.

    2. The market has to be visible **on the page** rather than merely in the
       domain's suffix.  ``brandt.be`` is a Belgian top-level domain whoever
       owns it, so letting the suffix answer the country question would be
       letting the candidate confirm itself.
    3. A domain that was *spelled* must sit on the market's own top-level
       domain.  This is the rule the corpus argues for: every namesake it has
       recorded - ``house.com``, ``adequat.com``, ``brightplus.com``,
       ``think-about-it.com`` - was a generic suffix, and so was the one this
       pass caught while it was being written.  ``adequat.eu`` answers "Adéquat
       levert kastanjehouten hekwerken uit Frankrijk", a chestnut fencing shop
       with a Belgian showroom: it is titled exactly "Adéquat", it shows
       Belgium, and it is not "Adéquat Belgium NV" the staffing agency.  A
       ``.be`` for a Belgian company is a far weaker coincidence than a
       ``.com`` or a ``.eu``, and requiring it costs this pass one confirmation
       in nine and buys the difference between a domain and a namesake.  It
       applies to spellings only: a domain the employer published, or the
       register did, is evidence in its own right and does not rest on the
       suffix.

    Companies are walked biggest vacancy count first, so the budget is spent

    twenty-seven single-vacancy names.  They are resolved ``concurrency``-wide
    because every company is a different site; the shared
    :class:`EgressClient` is what keeps that polite, since the per-domain rate
    limit and the robots.txt cache live on the client rather than on the task
    (FR-182, FR-305, CR-402).  The register rung is deliberately *not* run
    concurrently past that: it is one host, and its adapter's rate limit is the
    politeness.

    ``refresh`` walks companies that already carry a verdict; ``stale_days``
    says how old that verdict has to be first, and ``stale_days=0`` walks them
    however fresh it is - which is what a change to the gate calls for, since
    the reason to look again is the rule and not the clock.
