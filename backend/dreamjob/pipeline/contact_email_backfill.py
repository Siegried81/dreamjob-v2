"""Fill in e-mail addresses for stored contacts that have none (FR-303, FR-304).

The contacts pass in :mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.apply_contacts` answers "does this
company have anybody to write to" and stops at the first address it can justify.
By the time it is done, the corpus also holds *people* - a hiring manager read
off a team page, a department head from the company profile - whose row was
created without an address.  This module is the second question, asked of those
rows: each one already names a person and a company, so the machinery that has
already resolved the domain and learned its convention can be pointed at the
person rather than the company.

It is deliberately the same vocabulary as the first pass, reused rather than
re-implemented:

* :func:`apply_contacts.resolve_domain` - so a company whose record carries no
  domain is judged by the full CR-405 gate, not by a second, weaker spelling;
* :func:`email_patterns.collect_from_site` - the published addresses, read once
  per domain and cached for the whole pass (FR-305);
* :func:`email_patterns.learn_domain_pattern` and
  :func:`email_patterns.candidates_for_person` - the convention, learned from
  the addresses that exist, applied to the person;
* :func:`contacts._first_usable` and :func:`email_validate.validate` - FR-304,
  so an ``invalid`` address is never stored.

**Idempotent and resumable.**  The work list is a query for rows with no
address; the write is a single guarded ``UPDATE ... WHERE email IS NULL`` (see
:func:`repositories.contacts.set_contact_email`).  A second run therefore
selects nothing that the first filled, and a run resumed after a crash picks up
exactly where it stopped.  A row that gained an address, or an objection, while
the pass was running is left alone and reported as such.

**Nothing invented, nothing overwritten.**  An address is stored only when
FR-304 does not call it ``invalid``; a composed address is marked uncertain
unless it is ``valid``; an existing address is never touched; and NFR-302
objections are honoured in the selection and again in the write.
