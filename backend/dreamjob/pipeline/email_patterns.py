"""Finding and inferring professional e-mail addresses (FR-303, CR-402, RK-08).

FR-303 names four methods and asks for the one that produced each address to be
recorded.  They are tried in that order because it is also the order of
decreasing certainty and increasing intrusiveness:

``website``
    Addresses printed on the company's own contact, careers and legal pages.
    Published by the company for exactly this purpose, so both the strongest
    evidence and the least intrusive collection (CR-402).
``press``
    Addresses on press, newsroom and media pages.  Same standing, usually a
    role mailbox.
``pattern_inference``
    No address for the person, but the domain's convention can be read off the
    addresses that *are* published.  :func:`infer_pattern` scores the
    convention against the named addresses it has seen; a guess derived from a
    weak convention stays a guess, which is why the confidence travels with the
    address and FR-304 validation still has to pass before it is used.
``lookup_service``
    A permitted third-party enrichment service.  OQ-05 has not settled which
    services are acceptable in terms of cost and data protection, so the client
    is complete but the feature is **off by default** and refuses to run until
    an administrator names a provider and switches it on.

Only professional addresses are collected, and nothing beyond the address, the
method and the page it came from is kept (FR-306, RK-08).

# The two runs are **bounded**, and it is not cosmetic.  An obfuscated "at" can
# appear inside parentheses in the middle of a word, so every occurrence of the
# marker is a place this pattern starts trying.  With an unbounded ``+`` in
# front of it, each attempt first swallows the whole surrounding run of
# local-part characters and then gives it back one character at a time, which is
# quadratic in the length of that run: a 40 kB base64 data: URI - one image
# inlined in a page - took 66 seconds, and a 400 kB one would have taken close
# to two hours.  It froze a contacts pass mid-crawl, and because
# :func:`collect_from_site` runs inside the event loop it froze every other
# company with it.
#
# 64 and 255 are the RFC 5321 maxima for a local part and a domain, which is the

# exist is lost - only the backtracking is.
#
# The separators must be **explicitly obfuscated** - wrapped in parentheses,
# brackets, braces or HTML entities.  That is not decoration: without it, the
# pattern read plain prose as an address.  "adjust this data privacy statement
# at any point in time" became ``statement@any.in``, "coordination point for"
# became ``coordin@ion.for``, "creative point of view" became ``cre@ive.of``
# and "escalation point and on-call" became ``escal@ion.and`` - and those
# fragments were then adopted as employer domains by the backup stage.  A bare
# "at" and a bare "dot" are English words in every paragraph ever written about
# a point of view; only the parenthesised spelling is evidence that somebody
# meant an address.  The bare ``dot``/``punt`` alternative is kept because the
