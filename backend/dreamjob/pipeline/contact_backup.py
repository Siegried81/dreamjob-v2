"""Backup contact discovery when the normal ladder finds nothing (FR-303).

Measured on the live corpus: 3,350 of 5,960 companies (56%) have no usable
contact e-mail, 3,324 of them are recorded ``unreachable``, and 97.7% of those
have no employer domain at all.  The ladder in
:mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.apply_contacts` is right to refuse to spell an address
on a board host or on a domain the identity gate never confirmed - but it also
gives up, while two sources still hold an address the employer itself wrote
down: the postings the corpus already stores, and the applicant-tracking board
the employer uses.  This module reads those, and only those, when everything
else has failed.  It is a *source*, not a second ladder: nothing is stored and
nothing is decided here, the findings go back to the caller's FR-301 ranking,
FR-304 validation and NFR-302 checks.

Sources, in the order tried:

``stored_document``
    The ``application_target`` and ``description`` of the company's stored
    postings, plus the URL fields (``source_url``, ``application_target`` and a
    JSON ``application_url``) for the employer's registrable domain.  No
    network: the text is already in the database.
``ats_board``
    The career board resolved from ``company.careers_url``, from
    ``detect.board_url(ats_vendor, ats_slug)``, or from the most common vacancy
    ``source_url`` host.  At most ``max_pages`` pages, fetched through the
    shared :class:`~dreamjob.egress.client.EgressClient` so robots.txt, pacing
    and caching apply exactly as everywhere else (FR-182, CR-402).  E-mails are
    read from the text and from JSON-LD, and an employer domain is recovered
    from ``hiringOrganization.url``/``sameAs`` and from links that are not
    boards, free mailboxes or page-chrome noise.
``website`` / ``pattern_inference``
    When a domain was recovered and ``crawl_site`` is on, the ordinary
    :func:`~dreamjob.pipeline.email_patterns.collect_from_site` and
    :func:`~dreamjob.pipeline.email_patterns.generic_candidates` run on it and
    keep their own labels.  An address printed on the site is published and is
    not uncertain; a composed generic stays ``pattern_inference`` and stays
    uncertain (FR-303, migration 151).

Bounds and politeness: one egress client, ``max_pages`` board pages and
``max_pages`` crawl pages per company, at most ``STORED_POSTING_LIMIT`` stored
postings, one log line per company.  Nothing is written.
