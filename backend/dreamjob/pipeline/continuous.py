"""The endless background data-collection cycle (FR-161..166, FR-185, FR-221..246, FR-301..303, FR-281).

An administrator switches this on and the product keeps expanding its corpus on
its own, one *phase* per interval, for as long as it stays on:

============================  ==================================================
phase                         what it advances
============================  ==================================================
``discover``                  the next ready job seeker's autopilot run: the
                              resumable chain that builds a profile into a
                              planned, collected, ranked campaign (FR-161..166)
``contacts``                  the FR-301/FR-303 corpus: fill in e-mail
                              addresses for stored contacts, and rotate in a
                              discovery pass so newly collected companies get
                              somebody to write to as well
``enrich``                    the cursor seeker's campaign first - company
                              profiles and their financials (FR-221..246) - or
                              the shared knowledge base when there is no
                              campaign yet
``score``                     the deterministic ranking pass over the cursor
                              seeker's campaign (FR-281); no model is called
============================  ==================================================

The cycle is a state machine in ``app_setting``, not in memory: ``enabled``,
``interval_seconds``, ``phase``, ``seeker_cursor``, ``last_tick``,
``last_phase_at`` and ``last_report``.  A restart therefore resumes where it
stopped, and the admin screen reads the same rows the engine writes.

Two properties make it safe to run inside the API process:

*It gives way - per phase.*  A phase is gated only by the jobs it would stack
on (:data:`PHASE_JOB_KINDS`): ``discover`` waits for its own autopilot chain
(not for an unrelated manual collection - its own caps are small enough to run
alongside one), ``contacts`` for a contact backfill or discovery, ``enrich``
for company enrichment or financial analysis.  ``score`` is deterministic,
cheap and never gated, so ranking keeps advancing while a collection runs.  A
deferral is recorded in ``continuous.last_attempt`` with its reason and the
next tick tries again; only a phase that actually runs stamps
``last_phase_at``.  The scheduler task that calls it ticks every five minutes,
and the engine itself enforces the configured interval, so a short tick never
runs a phase early.

*It never raises out of a tick.*  A phase that fails is recorded in
``last_report`` with its error and the cycle advances to the next phase, so one
broken source or one unready profile cannot stop the loop.
