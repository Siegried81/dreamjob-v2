"""Five-year financial analysis and the two hiring scores (FR-243..246, RK-06).

A company's financial trajectory is the proxy for two things a job seeker
cannot ask about directly: whether it can pay well, and whether it is investing
in the kind of new activity that creates a role.  This module turns the stored
filings into those two answers.

The arithmetic is deterministic and lives here in full - compound growth of
revenue and headcount, margin trend, personnel cost per FTE, current ratio,
solvency ratio, and the growing/stable/declining/volatile classification with a
confidence that falls with the number of years available and with every
reconciliation flag the extractor raised (FR-243, NFR-404).

The two 0-100 scores (FR-244) are also deterministic: a model that scores
companies would be neither reproducible nor auditable.  What the model writes
is the *rationale*, and it is held to one rule - it must name the figures it
used.  A rationale that cites no numbers is rejected, retried once, and then
replaced by a generated sentence that does cite them.

FR-245: a company with no usable filings is not skipped.  Its profile is built
from secondary signals - funding rounds, headcount growth, press - scored
conservatively, and marked ``is_estimated`` everywhere it surfaces.

FR-246: where a registry exposes the parent/subsidiary relation, the group is
recorded and the consolidated picture is computed alongside the entity-level
one; both are returned, and the difference between them is usually the whole
story of a Belgian subsidiary of a foreign group.
