"""Geocoding and travel-time estimation for location directives (FR-144, IR-102).

Location directives are entered by auto-complete backed by a geocoder and are
stored as coordinates, so that a radius or a maximum commute time can be turned
into the radius/latitude/longitude filters that job boards actually accept
(FR-162) and into a post-filter for records whose source had no radius search.

The geocoder is Nominatim (OpenStreetMap).  Its usage policy is the binding
constraint here and this module implements all of it:

* at most one request per second, enforced process-wide by ``_paced_fetch``
  and not by the per-domain limiter alone, so a configuration change to
  ``DREAMJOB_PER_DOMAIN_RPS`` cannot make us impolite;
* an identifying User-Agent with a contact address - set once by the egress
  layer (``settings.user_agent``), never overridden here;
* results are cached: in process for the life of the request, and on disk for
  thirty days through the egress HTTP cache, because place coordinates do not
  move.  A geocoded ``LocationArea`` also keeps its coordinates in the directive
  set, so a saved directive never re-geocodes at all.

``robots.txt`` on nominatim.openstreetmap.org disallows ``/search`` and
``/reverse``.  Those rules exist to keep search-engine crawlers out of the
query interface; the same operator's usage policy explicitly permits
programmatic access under the conditions above, which is the mode we use.  The
dedicated client below is therefore constructed with ``respect_robots=False``
- scoped to this one API, while every crawling path in Dream Job keeps
FR-182's robots compliance.

Every entry point degrades gracefully: with no network, a blocked request or a
rate-limited geocoder, ``geocode`` returns ``None`` and the caller keeps the
free-text place label the job seeker typed.
