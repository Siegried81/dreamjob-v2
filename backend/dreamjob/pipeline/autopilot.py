"""Autopilot: one action that carries a profile to a ranked shortlist.

The product owner's model of the product is three steps — create your profile,
review and select what came back, apply — with everything between them running
on its own. Before this module, every stage between those steps was a separate
button on a separate screen: enrich, synthesise, confirm the dream job,
propose directives, save directives, create a campaign, plan, launch. That is
eight decisions the product can make for itself.

This module is the missing orchestrator (FR-161..166, FR-181..186, FR-121..128,
FR-261..285). It is deliberately *thin*: every stage it runs already existed and
already has its own tests. What is new is only the order, the defaults, and the
promise that a failure in one stage is reported rather than swallowed.

The chain
---------
1. **Composite profile** (FR-121) — synthesise what the documents and any
   approved enrichment already established.
2. **Dream-job model** (FR-128) — turn the free-text statement into structure.
   Absent a statement this step is skipped, not failed: it is the one input a
   profile can legitimately be missing.
3. **Directives** (FR-147) — propose a full directive set from the profile and
   *save it*. The proposal function already existed; nothing ever called it on
   the job seeker's behalf, so the largest decision surface in the product sat
   between the user and their first result.
4. **Campaign** (FR-161) — create it from the saved directives.
5. **Plan** (FR-162) — per-source native queries, bounded by the defaults.
6. **Collection** (FR-181) — launch it. Ranking runs automatically at the end
   of collection already (see ``collection._rank_collected``), so the shortlist
   exists when collection returns.
7. **Company profiles and financials** (FR-221..246) for the companies that
   actually produced an opportunity, bounded by a limit.
8. **Notify** — one notification saying the shortlist is ready, so the user
   does not have to watch a progress bar.

Everything is tunable
---------------------
The defaults are opinionated but every one is a field on :class:`AutopilotOptions`
and can be overridden per run from the start screen. Nothing here is a new
consent: the CR-410 gate on sending profile data to the model provider is
checked by ``composite.build_composite`` itself, and autopilot refuses to start
without it rather than discovering the problem halfway through.

Nothing is sent
---------------
This module prepares. It never generates an application package and never sends
an email (NFR-305); between "ranked shortlist" and "outbound message" there is
still a human choosing opportunities and approving drafts.
