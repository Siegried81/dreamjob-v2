"""Online enrichment of the job seeker's profile (FR-122, FR-126, FR-127).

The pipeline is four steps:

1. **Anchors** - name variants, employers, locations, schools, declared URLs and
   the career date span are read out of the profile (``identity_match``).
2. **Search** - the open web is queried for the job seeker through DuckDuckGo's
   HTML endpoint, which needs no API key.  Queries are built from the anchors,
   not from a fixed template, so a profile with two employers produces two
   employer queries and one with ten produces ten.
3. **Fetch and extract** - every candidate page goes through ``EgressClient``
   (robots, rate limits, raw-document capture) and then through the LLM, with
   the page body passed as an ``untrusted`` block: a scraped page is hostile
   input (NFR-205).
4. **Score and store** - each finding is scored by ``identity_match`` and
   written to ``enrichment_finding`` with its per-signal evidence.  Only
   ``confirmed`` findings will later be merged automatically (FR-124).

Two things this module deliberately does *not* do:

* **FR-127** - special-category data is stripped before anything is persisted.
  Findings are filtered through ``strip_special_categories`` on the way to the
  database, and people-search aggregators - the places that publish exactly
  this kind of data about a person - are excluded from the candidate set
  outright.
* **FR-126** - when the job seeker has switched enrichment off, no request
  leaves the machine.  ``run_enrichment`` returns an empty, explicitly disabled
  report and the composite builder falls back to user-supplied data only.

Search availability is treated as a degradation, not an error.  DuckDuckGo
serves a bot-check page to datacentre IP ranges; when that happens the search
step reports itself unavailable and enrichment continues against the anchor
URLs the profile already declares plus the handle-derived candidates, which is
where the highest-value findings (personal site, repositories, newsletter) live
anyway.
