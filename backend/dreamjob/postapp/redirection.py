"""Advice on where to redirect the search (extends FR-285 and FR-425).

The product owner's ask, in their words: *if a lot of rejections are received
for a certain type of job then the AI should advise on how to redirect the type
of job/company to get higher acceptance rates.*

That is a genuinely useful thing to automate and a genuinely easy thing to do
badly, so this module is built around three rules:

1. **The numbers come first, the model second.**  Segment rates, sample sizes
   and Wilson intervals are computed deterministically in ``segments.py``.  The
   model is given those figures and asked to turn them into advice - it is
   never asked to find the pattern itself, because a language model asked to
   spot trends in a table will find one whether or not it is there.

2. **Nothing is applied automatically.**  Advice becomes a proposed change to a
   directive set that the job seeker reviews and accepts.  Accepting creates a
   new directive-set version; the old one is never mutated (FR-148, NFR-305).

3. **Advice states what it rests on.**  Every proposal carries the two rates,
   both sample sizes and the confidence label.  Where the evidence is thin the
   advice says so rather than sounding confident anyway - a job seeker acting
   on six data points deserves to know that is what they are doing.

SYSTEM = """You advise a job seeker on where to redirect their search, based on \
measured outcome rates from applications they have already sent.

You are given a table of segments. Each row is a kind of job or company, the \
number of applications that resolved in that segment, how many reached the \
target outcome, the observed rate, and a plausible range for that rate. You are \
also given the job seeker's current search directives and their dream-job model.

Your job is to turn those figures into advice a person can act on this week.

Rules you must follow:
- Base every claim on the figures given. Never invent a rate, a count or a segment.
- Always name the sample size in the rationale. "3 of 14" is honest; "performs \
poorly" alone is not.
- Where the evidence is labelled thin or indicative, say the pattern is not yet \
established and frame the suggestion as something to test, not something to do.
- Never recommend abandoning something central to the dream-job model just \
because its numbers are weak so far. Say plainly when the data conflicts with \
what the person said they want, and let them decide.
- Prefer redirection to retreat: pair a weak segment with a stronger one the \
person is already succeeding in, rather than only saying what to stop.
- A rejection is information about fit, timing or targeting - not about worth. \
Write as a level-headed colleague would, not as a coach.
