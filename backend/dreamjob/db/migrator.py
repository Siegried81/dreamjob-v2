"""Versioned schema migrations (CR-408).

Migrations are plain ``.sql`` files named ``NNN_description.sql`` in
``db/migrations``.  They run once, in filename order, inside a transaction,
and are recorded in ``schema_migration``.  There is no down-migration: a
mistake is corrected by a new forward migration, which keeps the applied
history honest.
