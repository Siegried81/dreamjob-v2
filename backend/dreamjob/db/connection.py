"""SQLite access layer (CR-408, NFR-102).

Design points that the rest of the codebase depends on:

* WAL mode, so many readers run concurrently with one writer.
* A single global write gate.  SQLite serialises writers anyway; taking the
  gate in-process turns "database is locked" retries into an orderly queue
  (NFR-102).
* All SQL lives here and in ``db/repositories``.  Nothing else in the code
  base issues SQL, which is what keeps a later move to PostgreSQL feasible
  (CR-408).
* Rows come back as ``sqlite3.Row`` and are converted to plain dicts by the
  repositories, so callers never hold a cursor open.

The write gate, and why it is not a bare ``RLock`` any more
-----------------------------------------------------------
It used to be ``threading.RLock()``.  That serialises writers, which is the
invariant, but it says nothing about *who waits and for how long* - and that
turned out to be the half that matters.

1. **An RLock is not fair.**  CPython hands the lock to whichever waiter the
   OS wakes first, and a thread that releases and immediately re-acquires can
   keep winning.  A collection job writing 2,686 plan items does exactly that,
   thousands of times a minute.  A request that wants to write can lose the
   race indefinitely - starvation with no upper bound and nothing in the log.
2. **The wait had no ceiling.**  ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` runs *inside* the gate and
   can block for ``busy_timeout`` (15 s) when another *process* holds the
   database - a second uvicorn, a script, a ``sqlite3`` shell.  Each waiter
   pays that in turn, so with W writers queued the last one waits W x 15 s.
   Nothing bounded W, and nothing bounded the wait.

So the gate is explicit: a FIFO queue with two lanes.

* ``interactive`` - anything serving a person.  This is the default, so no
  caller has to know the lane exists.
* ``bulk`` - background job work.  ``jobs/runner.py`` puts every job thread in
  this lane, and interactive writers are served ahead of it.

A job therefore never queues in front of a request.  The worst an interactive
writer can wait is the one transaction already in flight (bounded by
``busy_timeout`` plus its own work), not the thousands of writes a campaign
still has to do.  Both lanes have a deadline: waiting for ever is how an
outage looks from the inside, so a writer that cannot be served raises
:class:`WriteLockTimeout` and the request fails in a way somebody can read.

Strict priority would starve the other side, so after
``_BULK_RELIEF_EVERY`` consecutive interactive grants a queued bulk writer is
let through.  A campaign under continuous API load slows down; it does not
stop.

The gate stays **re-entrant**: the same thread may take it again while it
holds it.  ``write_tx`` inside ``write_tx`` on one thread is a programming
error - SQLite refuses the second ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` with "cannot start a
transaction within a transaction" - and failing there is much better than
deadlocking on our own gate (tests/unit/test_runner_isolation.py pins this).
