"""Opportunity, scoring and compensation SQL (FR-261..265, FR-281..285, FR-383).

``opportunity`` is a **private** table, so every statement here takes a
``job_seeker_id`` and filters on it (FR-101, FR-344).  The rows it points at -
``company``, ``vacancy``, ``contact``, ``compensation_observation``,
``employer_review_summary`` - are shared knowledge-base rows and carry no link
back to a job seeker; they are only ever joined *outwards* from an opportunity
the caller already proved they own.

Two ordering rules are encoded here rather than in the pipeline, because they
are what the ranked list means:

``ORDER BY (manual_rank IS NULL), manual_rank``
    FR-284: a manual position always wins over the computed one.  Recomputation
    writes scores and never touches ``manual_rank``, so the seeker's order
    survives it.
``pinned DESC, score DESC``
    the computed order, applied only where the seeker has not spoken.
