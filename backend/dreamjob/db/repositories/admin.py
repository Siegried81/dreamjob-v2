"""Administration storage: settings, catalogue, LLM log, audit (FR-361..364, NFR-701, NFR-702).

All SQL behind the administration screens lives here (CR-408).  Four groups:

* ``app_setting`` accessors, which hold the administrator's LLM configuration
  and per-source caps as versioned key/value rows (FR-362, FR-363).
* ``source_catalogue`` accessors, including the IR-101 acknowledgement stamp
  and the reconciliation that keeps a row honest about what will actually
  happen when the source is collected (FR-161, FR-185).
* ``llm_call`` reads plus the retention sweep that nulls prompt and response
  text after a retention period (FR-364).
* ``audit_event`` insert and read.  There is deliberately no update or delete
  helper: the trail is append-only (NFR-702).

# Catalogue honesty (FR-161, FR-164, FR-182, FR-185, IR-101)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# ``SourceAdapter.register`` writes what an adapter says about itself.  Two
# kinds of untruth survive that, and the FR-185 dashboard reads both:
#
# * **The rate a source asks for is not the rate it gets.**  The catalogue
#   recorded ``rate_limit_rps = 1.0`` for the seven ATS hosts while
#   ``DomainLimiter`` ran every one of them at the global 0.5, and
#   ``planning.estimate()`` prices a plan off the catalogue value - so the
#   duration the user approved was half the duration the run would take
#   (docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md section 2.2 and appendix A).  It cut the other
#   way for EURES: europa.eu publishes ``Crawl-delay: 10``, so the row's 0.5
#   promised twenty times the throughput the limiter will allow.
# * **A row can outlive its adapter.**  ``broken_board`` and ``stub_board``
#   were test fixtures that leaked into the installed database; source
#   selection (FR-164) could not tell them from real sources and spent a plan
#   item on each, every campaign (plan item C5).  Fourteen more had joined them
#   by the time this was written.
#
# :func:`reconcile_catalogue` is the pass that fixes both.  It runs after
# registration, from ``dreamjob.adapters.sync_catalogue``.

#: ``Crawl-delay``, in seconds, published by the host an adapter reads, from
#: robots.txt measured on 2026-09-09.  The egress layer honours whatever
#: robots.txt says at run time (FR-182); the catalogue needs the number
