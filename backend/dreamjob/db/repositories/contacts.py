"""Hiring-contact SQL (FR-301..FR-306, FR-461, NFR-302, NFR-303, RK-08).

Three data domains meet in this module and the rules differ for each:

``contact`` (SHARED, restricted)
    Professional contact details of third parties.  FR-306 fixes the column
    set - name, role, company, professional e-mail, source, date - and
    :data:`MINIMAL_COLUMNS` is the gate every write passes through, so a caller
    that hands over a phone number, a personal address or a scraped biography
    simply loses it.  That gate is the RK-08 control.

``contact_objection`` (SHARED, permanent)
    NFR-302 blocks an address for good.  Because NFR-303 deletes the contact
    row when the campaign's retention deadline passes, the block cannot live on
    the contact row alone; it lives here and the migration's triggers re-apply
    it to any re-collected copy.  :func:`usable_contacts_for_company` and
    :func:`best_contacts` read the ``usable_contact`` view, so the generation
    slice inherits the block through its query rather than through the UI.

``network_member`` / ``introduction_path`` (PRIVATE)
    The job seeker's own network and the routes built from it.  Every statement
    filters on ``job_seeker_id`` (FR-101, FR-344).

NFR-303 retention is enforced by :func:`sweep_retention`, which deletes both
browser-collected contacts and network members whose ``retention_until`` has
passed.  It is a plain function so the monitoring scheduler can call it.
