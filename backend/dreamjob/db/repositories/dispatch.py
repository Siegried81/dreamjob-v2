"""Dispatch, mailbox and inbox SQL (FR-325, FR-326, FR-327, NFR-204, NFR-702).

Everything this slice reads or writes goes through this module (CR-408).

Three groups of tables meet here and the isolation rules differ:

``dispatch`` / ``incoming_reply`` (PRIVATE)
    The send log FR-326 asks for and the replies it is matched against.  Every
    statement filters on ``job_seeker_id``; reply matching in particular is
    scoped to the mailbox owner, so one job seeker's Message-ID can never
    resolve to another's dispatch (FR-101, FR-344).

``mail_account`` / ``mail_oauth_state`` / ``mail_poll_state`` (PRIVATE)
    Mailbox credentials.  ``credentials_enc`` only ever passes through here as
    an opaque blob - encryption and decryption live in ``mail.gmail`` and
    ``security.crypto`` (NFR-204).  :func:`list_accounts` never selects it, so
    the API surface cannot leak it by accident.

``contact`` / ``company`` / ``application_package`` (read-only joins)
    The dispatcher needs the recipient's address and validation verdict
    (FR-304), the company's country for the recipient time zone (FR-325) and
    the package's approval stamp (NFR-702).  It reads them, never writes them.
