"""Shared knowledge-base SQL (FR-341, FR-343, FR-344, FR-345, NFR-402).

Everything in this module reads or writes a *shared* table: company, vacancy,
contact, financial_year, hiring_signal, competitor_link, event, provenance.
Shared rows are the knowledge base every campaign draws on, so:

* no statement here accepts or stores a ``job_seeker_id`` - ``sanitise`` raises
  rather than letting one through (FR-344);
* every write refreshes the FTS index that backs the campaign-independent
  browse/search interface (FR-345);
* every write carries freshness metadata so the planner can decide reuse
  against the staleness policy (FR-343).

    """Refresh one company's entry in ``company_fts`` (FR-345).

    Keyed by ``company.rowid``, not by ``company_id``.  ``company_id`` is
    declared UNINDEXED, which means FTS5 stores the value and indexes nothing,
    so ``DELETE ... WHERE company_id = ?`` had no index to seek on and SQLite
    scanned the whole table for every company written - the plan said ``SCAN
    company_fts VIRTUAL TABLE INDEX 0:``, and the cost grew with the corpus
    (6,674 virtual-machine steps per re-index at 500 companies, 52,174 at
    4,000).  FTS5 does seek on rowid: ``INDEX 0:=``, 164 steps at either size.

    That is the whole of the change.  The declaration, the tokens and the
    ``company_id`` the two search queries join on are exactly as they were, so
    a company search answers what it answered before - which is the point.
    ``vacancy_fts`` had the identical defect at 35,159 rows of 3.9 KiB each and
    is fixed differently in migration 133, as an external-content index
    maintained by triggers.  ``company_fts`` cannot follow it there:
    ``products_services`` is JSON that ``_flatten`` renders to prose before it
    is indexed, and an external-content table re-reads the base column, so
    every company would start matching a search for "description".  A change to
    what a search answers has no business travelling inside a performance fix.

    What the seek costs is an invariant somebody has to keep: every
    ``company_fts`` entry sits at the ``company.rowid`` of the company it
    describes.  Nothing in the product breaks it - the rebuild in migration 133
    establishes it and every write here maintains it - but SQLite renumbers the
    rowids of a TEXT-keyed table on a restore from ``.dump`` (measured: 15 of
    17), and the index is not told.  A misaligned entry does not go stale, it
    goes wrong and stays silent: the DELETE below removes whichever company now
    occupies that rowid, so that company disappears from search while this one
    ends up indexed twice, and every later write repeats it.  The repair is
    :func:`reindex_all`, which re-keys both indexes; ``'rebuild'`` on this
    table is accepted and repairs nothing, because a standalone FTS5 table
    rebuilds from its own shadow copy and keeps the rowids it already had.
    Prefer a binary ``.backup`` over a dump, which preserves rowids and needs
    none of this.

    answering nothing.

    This is also the repair for rowid drift.  Both indexes are addressed by
    their base table's rowid since migration 133, and a restore from ``.dump``
    renumbers those rowids without telling either index - after which a company
    write deletes another company's entry and a vacancy's words answer for its
