-- ===========================================================================
-- A semantic index over the corpus (FR-261, FR-282)
--
-- Matching was keyword-only: the ranked list reads FTS5 and the dream-fit
-- comparison reads one record at a time with an eight-thousand-token model
-- call.  Neither can answer "which postings are like this one" without the
-- model, and the model cannot be run over fifty thousand rows.
--
-- The vector is stored as a JSON array of floats, so the feature carries no
-- numerical dependency and works on the SQLite the product already ships.  It
-- is populated only when an embeddings model is configured; an installation
-- without one simply has an empty table and no new behaviour.
