"""Opportunities API: ranking, comparison, user control (FR-261..285, FR-383).

The route order follows how the screen is used: look at the ranked list, filter
it, open one, compare a few side by side, then take control of the order.

Two rules run through every response in this module.

**FR-263** - a speculative opening is never presented as a vacancy.  Every
opportunity that leaves here carries ``kind``, ``is_speculative``,
``kind_label`` and ``disclosure_note``, produced by
:mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.speculative`, so no client can render one without the
distinction being available.

**NFR-305 / CR-405** - scoring is advisory.  Recalculation writes scores and
nothing else; the manual order, pins, tags and statuses belong to the job
seeker and no automated pass may touch them (FR-284).
