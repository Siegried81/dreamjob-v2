"""The Apply Browser API (FR-301, FR-304, FR-321..FR-331, FR-325, NFR-302, RK-05).

One surface over machinery that already exists.  Nothing here writes a CV,
infers an address or assembles a MIME message: :mod:`dreamjob.documents`,
:mod:`dreamjob.pipeline.contacts` and :mod:`dreamjob.mail` do all of that.  This
router's job is to put them in the one order a person actually works through -

    browse -> select -> find who to write to -> generate -> read and edit -> send

- and to make the last step safe.

``GET /browser`` is the list, and it is one query: ``db.repositories.apply``
joins the opportunity, its company, its live package and the contact that would
receive the message, so a page of fifty rows costs one round trip rather than
fifty follow-up requests to find out whether each has a contact.  The contact
column reads through ``usable_contact``, which means an address FR-304
validated ``invalid`` and one whose owner objected (NFR-302) are already gone
before this router sees the row.

``/send``, ``/send-all`` and ``/send-status`` go through
:mod:`dreamjob.mail.dry_run`.  While ``DREAMJOB_MAIL_DRY_RUN`` is on - and it
is on by default - the whole dispatch path runs and stops at the transport: the
message is assembled with the tailored CV attached, written to
``data/generated/dry_run/``, and recorded as a dispatch with
``delivery_status='dry_run'``; the response says in words that nothing was
sent and why.  The guard is in the mail layer rather than here, so importing it
protects every other send path in the process too, and this router could not
put a message on the wire even if it tried.

Two documents are downloadable by the job seeker and never attachable to
anything: the briefing (FR-329) and the motivation document (FR-330).
``package.document_path`` refuses them for a dispatch, and ``composer`` refuses
them again by path on the way to a message (FR-321).
