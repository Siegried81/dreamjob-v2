"""Response capture and redirection advice API (extends FR-285, FR-326, FR-425).

Two things the product owner asked for after the specification was baselined:

* responses that arrive outside a pollable mailbox can be entered by hand and
  are then treated exactly like detected ones;
* outcomes are analysed by the *kind of job and company* applied for, and where
  a segment underperforms the system proposes a concrete change of direction.

Advice is never applied on its own.  Accepting a proposal writes a new
directive-set version, which the job seeker can review and revert (NFR-305).
