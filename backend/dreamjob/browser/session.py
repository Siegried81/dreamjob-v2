"""Attaching to the browser the user launched and logged into (FR-201, FR-202, FR-208).

The whole design of this slice follows from one rule: Dream Job never holds a
third-party site credential.  The *user* starts a browser with a remote
debugging port and a dedicated profile directory, logs in to LinkedIn or
Glassdoor with their own hands, and the system attaches to that live session
over the DevTools Protocol (FR-201, FR-202).  Nothing here asks for a
password, reads a cookie jar, exports a storage state or writes a session
token anywhere (NFR-203) - :func:`sanitise_capture` and
:func:`strip_credential_fields` exist precisely so a stored page cannot smuggle
one in either.

A dedicated profile directory (``settings.browser_profile_dir``) is not a
detail: it keeps the user's everyday browser profile untouched, which is part
of the RK-01 mitigation, and it means the automation window is visibly
separate from the one they browse with (FR-206).

FR-208: Chromium-family browsers are driven over CDP; Firefox is offered as an
alternative through a Playwright-managed persistent context, since Firefox
speaks its own remote protocol rather than CDP.
