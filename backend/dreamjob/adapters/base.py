"""Common source-adapter interface (NFR-601, FR-161, FR-181, IR-101).

Every external source - job board, ATS, company directory, financial
registry, company website, compensation site, news feed, event feed - is
implemented as a subclass of ``SourceAdapter`` with the same four-step shape:

    plan()      -> turn directives + composite profile into native queries
    fetch()     -> pull raw material through the egress layer
    parse()     -> extract structured records from raw material
    normalise() -> map records onto the shared knowledge-base schema

Because the pipeline only ever calls those four methods, adding a new board
or registry needs no change anywhere else (NFR-601).  Each adapter also
declares its coverage, access method and terms-of-service status, which the
source catalogue stores and the planner uses to select sources (FR-161,
FR-164, IR-101).
