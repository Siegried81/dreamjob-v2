"""Shared machinery for company-registry adapters (FR-241, DR-101, IR-102).

A registry is not a job board.  It is asked about one company at a time, it
answers with an identity record and a list of annual deposits, and its value to
Dream Job is twofold: it is the DR-101 identity anchor (the legal identifier
that makes de-duplication reliable), and it is the only place the last five
financial years actually exist (FR-241).

So every registry adapter implements the four-step ``SourceAdapter`` contract -
the planner and the job runner know nothing else - but the useful work happens
in :meth:`RegistryAdapter.collect`, which the financial pipeline calls directly
with a company row and gets back a :class:`RegistryResult`.

Several registries need a key that this deployment may not have (Companies
House, KvK, OpenCorporates, the NBB Consult subscription).  None of them is
allowed to fail loudly for that reason: :meth:`RegistryAdapter.available`
returns ``False``, the plan skips the source, and the company's financial
profile is marked ``estimated`` (FR-245, RK-06).
