"""EURES adapter - the European Commission's job mobility portal (FR-181, FR-183).

EURES aggregates the vacancies of the national public employment services of
the EU/EEA, which makes it the one genuinely open, pan-European vacancy source
in this package: no key, no account, public-sector data.

Endpoint shape implemented (the portal's own JSON search service, read out of
the portal bundle it is served with):

    POST {api_base}/jv-search/search?lang=en
    {"keywords": [{"keyword": "data engineer", "specificSearchCode": "EVERYWHERE"}],
     "locationCodes": ["BE"], "resultsPerPage": 50, "page": 1,
     "sortSearch": "BEST_MATCH"}
    -> {"numberRecords": n, "jvs": [{"id", "title", "description",
        "creationDate" (epoch ms), "locationMap": {"BE": ["BE32B"]},
        "employer": {...}|null, ...}], "facets": [...]}

    GET  {api_base}/jv/id/{id}?requestLang=en&preferredLang=en
    -> {"id", "reference", "source", "creationDate", "preferredLanguage",
        "jvProfiles": {"<lang>": {"title", "description", "locations": [...],
        "employer": {...}, "personContacts": [...], ...}}}

The portal was rebuilt as a single-page application and the old
``/eures/eures-apps/searchengine/page`` service was withdrawn: every search
against it answered 404 with an HTML stub, which the adapter recorded as
"nothing found".  ``api_base`` lives in ``native_query`` so an administrator can
follow the next migration without a code change (NFR-601), and a search that
cannot be reached now fails its plan item instead of reporting zero vacancies
(FR-185).

Detail pages are opt-in (``fetch_details``): one listing page carries fifty
summaries and each summary already holds the full advert text, so fetching a
detail per summary spends fifty rate-limited requests to add an employer name.

Measured against the live service on 2026-09-09 with this product's own
User-Agent (docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md C1/C2, appendix C):

* ``locationCodes: ["BE"]`` answers HTTP 200 with ``numberRecords`` 232,496 and
  fifty summaries carrying ``employer.name`` and a median 1.1-2.3 kB advert;
* ``resultsPerPage`` above fifty is refused - 100 and 200 both answer HTTP 400
  ``{"errorMessage": "Too many results per page were requested"}`` - so a plan
  item that asks for more is clamped here rather than spent on a 400;
* the partition filters the sweep in FR-186 needs are honoured:
  ``locationCodes: ["BE1"]`` (NUTS-1) with ``publicationPeriod: "LAST_WEEK"``
  narrows 232,496 to 1,593, and adding ``sectorCodes: ["N"]`` (NACE Rev 2.1
  section N, professional/scientific/technical activities) narrows it further
  to 482.

europa.eu's robots.txt permits ``/eures/`` and states ``Crawl-delay: 10`` for
``User-agent: *``; volume therefore comes from partitioning the query, never
from asking this host for more per request (FR-182, plan section 6.4).
