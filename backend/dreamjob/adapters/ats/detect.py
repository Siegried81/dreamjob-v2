"""ATS vendor detection from a careers page or company domain (FR-181, FR-222).

The company-profiling slice calls :func:`detect_ats` with the HTML of a
company's careers page (or its home page) and the URL it came from, and stores
the result in ``company.ats_vendor`` / ``company.ats_slug``.  Those two fields
are what turn a company row into a plan item for one of the ATS adapters, which
is the cheapest and freshest route to that company's open roles.

Detection is deliberately deterministic - three signals, in order of trust:

1. the URL itself, when the page *is* the board (``jobs.lever.co/acme``);
2. links in the page pointing at a board (a careers page nearly always links
   or iframes its ATS);
3. embedded board widgets (``boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_board?for=acme``,
   ``Grnhse.Iframe``, ``ashby_embed``, Recruitee's ``careers-site`` script).

Vendors without an adapter here (Workable, Teamtailor, SuccessFactors, ...) are
still reported: knowing which ATS a company runs is useful profiling
information even when Dream Job cannot read the board.  So is a vendor whose
tenant slug never appears - a board served on the company's own domain
(``jobs.acme.eu``) is recognised as ``("teamtailor", None)`` rather than as
nothing at all, which is the honest answer and tells an operator where to look
for the slug.

A detected slug is a guess until a board answers to it, so
:func:`detect_ats_verified` spends one keyless request confirming it before it
is written to ``company.ats_slug`` (FR-222).  Two Belgian companies were filed
under the slug ``careers-analytics`` - Recruitee's own analytics host, which
answers 403 - and every campaign afterwards planned a board that could not
exist.  Detection is for companies a user named and for the watchlist: at a
6.7% hit rate and ~30 requests per board found it is four orders of magnitude
worse than a board registry for bulk discovery, and it looks like a crawler to
every small-business website it touches (docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md N9, 6.6).
