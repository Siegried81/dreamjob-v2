"""Shared behaviour for applicant-tracking-system adapters (FR-181, FR-261, IR-102).

An ATS board is the freshest and cleanest description of what a company is
actually hiring for: it is the employer's own system of record, it is public,
and it is JSON.  Every vendor here exposes a keyless read-only endpoint, so the
adapters are ``AccessMethod.API`` and cost nothing per call.

All seven work the same way: the planner hands over a company and its board
slug (``company_lookup``), the adapter reads the whole board, and each posting
becomes one ``vacancy`` row.  Slugs come from ``company.ats_vendor`` /
``company.ats_slug``, which the company-profiling slice fills in using
:func:`dreamjob.adapters.ats.detect.detect_ats`.

Two shapes of plan item arrive here and both must work (they are the same work
item, only differently packaged):

* a :class:`~dreamjob.adapters.base.PlanItem` from ``plan()``, whose payload is
  the ``native_query`` attribute, carrying ``slug``;
* the ``source_plan_item`` row the collection worker reads back from the
  database as a plain dict, whose payload is ``row["native_query"]`` and which
  the campaign planner writes as ``board_slugs`` (a list).

:meth:`ATSAdapter.native_query` is therefore the only place any of these
adapters reads a plan item, and every one of them names *every* slug in the
list rather than only the first.
