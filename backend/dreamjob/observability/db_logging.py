"""Database logging (NFR-701).

What lands in ``logs/database.log`` and why:

* **Every write transaction** - table, operation, primary key, duration.  When
  a job seeker says "my directive did not save", this is the line that says
  whether the write happened at all.
* **Every statement slower than** ``DREAMJOB_LOG_SLOW_QUERY_MS`` at WARNING,
  with the statement, the elapsed time, *the CPU time it actually used* and
  *how many steps SQLite took*.  This is the line that finds a missing index;
  nothing else in the system will tell you.
* **The difference between a slow statement and a stalled process.**  Elapsed
  time is wall clock, and wall clock cannot tell "this query is expensive"
  from "this coroutine waited 68 seconds to be scheduled".  That ambiguity was
  not theoretical: a 173-second ``SELECT`` on a two-row table with a correct
  query plan was diagnosed as a missing index, and hours later a 68,862 ms
  lookup on a UNIQUE index over ``session`` was diagnosed the same way.  Both
  were a background job owning the event loop (``jobs/runner.py``).  So two
  things that *are* the statement's own cost are measured beside the clock -
  ``time.thread_time()`` for CPU and SQLite's progress handler for virtual
  machine steps - and a statement that burned neither is logged as ``stalled
  statement``, not ``slow statement``.  One is a query to fix; the other is a
  process that was not running.
* **Migrations**, with version and duration.
* **Lock waits and rollbacks.**  "database is locked" is the failure mode of a
  single-writer SQLite design (NFR-102), so it is logged whether or not
  statement tracing is on - a production incident must not be invisible
  because the cheap flag was off.
* **A periodic summary** at INFO: statements, writes, average duration.  A
  healthy system should produce evidence of health, not just silence.  It rides
  on the statement trace, so it is there whenever tracing is.

Privacy (NFR-201, NFR-702).  ``sqlite3.set_trace_callback`` hands us the
*expanded* SQL - SQLite inlines every bound value, so the string it gives us
literally contains CV text, e-mail addresses and phone numbers.  That string is
never logged.  :func:`redact` reduces a statement to its shape (every literal
becomes ``?``) and reports how many values it replaced; the only value that
ever reaches the file is a primary key, which is an opaque UUID.

Cost.  A trace callback builds a Python string for every statement executed,
which is real overhead, so all statement-level work sits behind
``DREAMJOB_LOG_SQL`` (default: on outside production).

This module logs through ``dreamjob.observability.logs.get_logger``.  If that
channel has no file behind it - a migration run from the command line, a
script, a test, none of which go through the application lifespan - it attaches
its own rotating handler on ``logs/database.log``, so database evidence never
depends on who started the process.
