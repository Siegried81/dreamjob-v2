"""Building the introduction e-mail (FR-321, FR-323, NFR-302, RK-05).

Three rules decide everything in this module.

**RK-05 - plain professional formatting.**  The message is ``text/plain``.  No
HTML alternative, no tracking pixel, no image, no marketing furniture: those
are the features spam filters weigh, and a cold application that lands in a
junk folder has failed regardless of how well it was written.  The body is the
text the job seeker approved, wrapped to a readable width, with a signature and
one closing sentence appended.

**FR-321 - the briefing and the motivation document are for the job seeker
only and are never sent.**  :func:`collect_attachments` attaches the tailored
CV and refuses, by path, anything that came from the briefing or motivation
columns of the package.  The check is on the value, not on the caller's good
intentions, so a future caller that passes the whole package dictionary still
cannot leak them.

**NFR-302 - every introduction e-mail carries an objection sentence.**  It is
appended in the language of the message and names the address to write to, so
a recipient's "please stop" reaches a mailbox that is actually read and can be
turned into a permanent block.
