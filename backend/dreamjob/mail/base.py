"""The mail backend interface (FR-325, NFR-204, RK-05).

FR-325 asks that dispatch use *the job seeker's own mailbox*, and section 2.4
states why: replies have to land in their inbox.  Two backends satisfy that to
different degrees, and the product owner wants both, so the difference is made
explicit rather than hidden:

``gmail_oauth``
    The job seeker's own Gmail, connected over OAuth 2.0.  Sends as them,
    threads in their Sent folder, and their inbox receives both the replies and
    the delivery-status notifications - the only backend that meets section 2.4
    in full.

``imap_basic``
    Any mailbox that speaks IMAP and SMTP with an address and an application
    password - Yahoo, iCloud, Outlook, a self-hosted server.  It meets section
    2.4 exactly as ``gmail_oauth`` does (the message leaves the job seeker's
    own mailbox, so replies and delivery-status notifications land in their own
    inbox); the difference is only in how the mailbox is authorised.  It exists
    because OAuth is not on offer everywhere: Yahoo, for one, has no public
    OAuth programme for third-party mail clients, and an application password
    is the credential it issues instead.

``resend``
    A transactional relay on ``stepvda.com``.  It sends when no personal
    mailbox is connected; ``Reply-To`` still points at the job seeker, but the
    delivery news arrives as a webhook rather than in their inbox, because the
    relay has no IMAP.

A backend is chosen per ``mail_account`` row, never per call site, so the
dispatcher's guard rails (FR-325) run identically whichever one is in force.
:class:`BackendCapabilities` is what the rest of the code branches on - the
dispatcher asks "does this backend detect bounces itself?", not "is this
Gmail?".
