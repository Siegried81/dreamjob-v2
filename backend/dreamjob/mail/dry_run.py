"""The dry-run transport guard (FR-325, RK-05, NFR-702, NFR-302, FR-304).

The product owner asked for the whole application pipeline up to a generated
e-mail with the tailored CV attached, and explicitly **not** the send.  That is
what this module is: a guard that lets every step run for real and stops one
step short of the wire.

Three properties make it a guard rather than a warning.

**It lives in the mail layer, not in a router.**  ``DREAMJOB_MAIL_DRY_RUN``
defaults to *true*, and while it is true :func:`install_transport_guard`
replaces every shipped :class:`~dreamjob.mail.base.MailBackend` in the registry
with a subclass whose ``send`` raises :class:`TransportBlocked` before the
provider is touched.  Every path that obtains a backend goes through that
registry - ``get_backend``, ``backend_for_account`` and therefore
``dispatcher.resolve_backend`` - so a future caller that reaches straight for
``dispatcher.send_package``, or a new router that nobody has reviewed, is
blocked by the same code as the Apply Browser.  A guard in the interface would
only have hidden the button.

**The whole path still runs.**  :func:`send_one` resolves the recipient, runs
the FR-325 / FR-304 / NFR-302 guard rails through
:func:`~dreamjob.mail.dispatcher.check_send_allowed`, composes the message with
:mod:`~dreamjob.mail.composer` - the tailored CV attached, the briefing and the
motivation document refused by FR-321, the NFR-302 objection sentence appended
- asks the backend for its own provider preconditions, and then writes the
assembled RFC 5322 message to ``data/generated/dry_run/`` and records a
dispatch row with ``delivery_status = 'dry_run'``.  What would have gone out is
therefore on disk, byte for byte, and can be opened in any mail client.

**Nothing pretends to have been sent.**  A dry-run dispatch never gets
``sent_at``, so it does not count against the FR-325 daily cap, does not pace
the next send, does not mark the package ``sent`` and does not move the
opportunity to ``applied``.  The API response says, in words, that nothing was
sent and why.

Two refusals are honoured even in a dry run, because they are about the
recipient rather than about the transport: an address that has objected
(NFR-302) and an address FR-304 will not allow.  Assembling a message for
either of those on disk would be building the thing the requirement forbids.
The refusals that only time will fix - the send window, the pacing rule, the
daily cap - do not stop a dry run; they are reported as what *would* have
happened.

Turning the guard off is deliberate and server-side: set
``DREAMJOB_MAIL_DRY_RUN=false`` in ``.env`` and restart the API.  From then on
:func:`send_one` and :func:`send_all` delegate to
:func:`~dreamjob.mail.dispatcher.send_package` unchanged, and the registry
wrapper stops blocking.
