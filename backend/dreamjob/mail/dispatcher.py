"""Sending guard rails and the send log (FR-325, FR-326, FR-327, NFR-702, RK-05).

RK-05 is the risk this module exists to control: a cold application that gets
classified as spam damages the sending reputation of the job seeker's own
mailbox, and no amount of good writing recovers from that.  FR-325 names the
four controls, and all four are enforced here, on the server, before the
backend is ever called - the user interface may show them, but it is not what
makes them true.

* **Rate** - at least ``settings.send_min_interval_seconds`` between sends.
* **Send window** - working hours *in the recipient's time zone*.  That is what
  the requirement says, and it is not the same as the sender's clock: a message
  written in Brussels at 09:00 arrives in San Francisco at midnight.  The zone
  is derived from the company's country and locations (:func:`timezone_for`)
  and ``zoneinfo`` does the arithmetic, daylight saving included.
* **Daily cap** - ``settings.send_daily_cap`` messages per calendar day.
* **Validated addresses only** - ``valid`` or ``risky`` (FR-304).  ``invalid``,
  unknown and never-validated addresses are refused.

A refusal that time will fix (window, rate, cap) queues the dispatch with
``scheduled_for`` set to the moment it becomes sendable; a refusal that time
will not fix (objection, invalid address, unapproved package) is final.

NFR-302 sits on top: a contact who has objected is never written to again, and
the check is made here rather than trusted from the caller.

NFR-702: every send is written to the audit trail with the approver, the
profile and document versions used, and the attachments that went out.
