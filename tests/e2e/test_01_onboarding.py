"""Onboarding, end to end: an empty account to a confirmed dream job.

This is the path every job seeker walks first, and the one that decides whether
they walk any of the others: register, land on "Where I am", import a LinkedIn
export and a CV, settle what the two documents disagree about (FR-103), tidy
the profile, decide what must never leave the building (FR-106), consent to the
transfer that the synthesis needs (CR-410), build the composite profile
(FR-121, FR-125) and turn the free-text statement into a confirmed model
(FR-109, FR-128).

The suite drives the SPA, never the API.  The one thing it asks the persona
files for is the two documents to upload and the two disagreements they were
built to contain, so the conflict assertions test the merge rather than
restating whatever the merge happened to produce.

Ordering matters here in a way it does not in a unit suite: each test continues
the account the one before it left.  ``_signed_in`` registers on first use and
signs the same account back in afterwards, so the file runs top to bottom and a
single test can still be run on its own — it simply starts from an emptier
account and says so through its own assertions.

The three tests that need the model are marked ``llm``: they call DeepSeek and
take one to three minutes each, so ``-m "not llm"`` runs the whole non-LLM half
of onboarding in about fifteen seconds.  The marker is not declared in
``pyproject.toml``'s ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]``; that file belongs to the
project rather than to this suite, and selection works without the
declaration — adding ``markers = ["llm: needs a live model call"]`` there would
only silence a possible strict-marker complaint.
