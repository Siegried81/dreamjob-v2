"""FR-184 de-duplication guards: a merge must be earned, not assumed.

These tests exist because the previous settings were *plausible* and wrong, and
wrongness in a de-duplicator is invisible: every discarded opening looks like a
successful merge, the run reports `done`, and the corpus is quietly 18%
smaller.  Measurements on real boards and the resulting decisions are in
docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md (section 3 step 9, section 5 C4 and N6):

* the fuzzy threshold was 0.86, which merged 18% of genuinely distinct openings
  on real boards; 0.92 retains 95.5%;
* "Data Engineer" in Brussels and "Data Engineer" in Ghent merged at 0.873 on
  the boards the plan measured - two stated, different places now veto a merge
  outright, so no agreement on title, employer and date can outvote them, and
  no later re-weighting of those three can bring the merge back;
* a differing number was noise: "Support Engineer (Level 6)" and "(Level 7)"
  scored a perfect 1.000, and "Magazijnier 100234" and "Magazijnier 100567"
  shared a deterministic key;
* an unknown location scored 0.6, which carried a pair over the old threshold
  on its own: "Data Engineer" in Brussels against "Data Engineer" with no
  stated place scored 0.900 and merged.

The centrepiece is ``test_a_board_of_227_openings_stays_227_rows``: a board of
227 reference-numbered postings was written as **six** rows, one per role name
(retention 2.6%, measured against this module before the change), because the
deterministic key threw every reference away as if it were a postcode.  Six
rows out of 227 was reported as a clean collection.
