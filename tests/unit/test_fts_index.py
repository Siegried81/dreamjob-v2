"""What one vacancy costs to index, and what the index owes the table (FR-345, NFR-103).

These tests exist because of one measurement.  A collection campaign of 2,685
plan items advanced six items in eleven minutes and wrote no vacancy at all in
a thirty-second sample.  Nothing had crashed and nothing was starved: the
slow-statement log named the statement, every two seconds, with the evidence
that it really was the statement's own cost::

    slow statement ms=1950.3 cpu_ms=1893.0 db_steps=420000 params=1
        sql=DELETE FROM vacancy_fts WHERE vacancy_id = ?

Both FTS tables were declared standalone with their key column UNINDEXED, so
the DELETE that ``_index_company`` and ``_index_vacancy`` issued before every
re-index had no index to seek on and SQLite scanned the whole table.  Writing
one row cost a pass over every row already written; filling the knowledge base
was therefore quadratic in the knowledge base, which is why a campaign got
slower the longer it ran.

Migration 133 fixes both, differently, and section 1 of this file is about the
property they now share rather than about either mechanism: **indexing one row
costs the same whatever the knowledge base already holds.**  A timing
threshold cannot pin that - it measures the machine, and this incident is a
whole file of evidence that wall clock cannot tell an expensive statement from
a loaded box.  What is measured instead is how many instructions SQLite's
virtual machine executes, through the same progress handler
``observability/db_logging.py`` already uses for ``db_steps``.  That count is a
property of the query plan and the data: the same number on a slow machine and
a fast one, and here the same number at two corpus sizes.

The rest of the file is the correctness the change buys and the correctness it
puts at risk.  ``vacancy_fts`` is now an external-content index: it keeps no
text of its own and addresses rows by ``vacancy.rowid``.  That is what removed
133 MB of duplicated corpus from a 617 MB file, and it is also a new way to be
wrong.  An entry the index fails to remove does not go dead - SQLite hands the
freed rowid to the next INSERT, so a deleted posting's words come back naming
whichever vacancy was written next.  Sections 3 and 4 pin that, and section 4
keeps its own control, because the FTS5 command that detects drift is not the
one the documentation makes obvious.

The last two tests are about the migration rather than the design it leaves
behind.  Every other test here starts from an empty database, where 133 has
almost nothing to do; the two statements that refill ``vacancy_fts`` and put
each ``company_fts`` entry back on its own rowid only do anything to a database
that already holds rows.  That is the database this migration was written for
and the only run of it that matters, so those two start at migration 132 with
rows indexed the old way and let the real migrator carry them across.

Everything here is offline and runs against a throw-away database.

    three columns where it averaged four; the join goes from ``v.id

    This one runs both statements over the same two hundred rows and diffs
    them.  The scores come out bit-identical, which is the answer to the bm25
    question: FTS5 records no tokens for an UNINDEXED column, so dropping it
    changes neither the document lengths nor the average the formula divides
    by.  What does move is order within an exact tie, and it moves because the
    old index had stopped being in table order - every re-collected vacancy was
    sitting at the end of it.  The new index is in table order and stays there,
    so the tie-break is now stable across a re-collection instead of depending
    on when a posting was last written.  That is a difference worth stating
    rather than papering over, so the assertion allows it and only it: any
