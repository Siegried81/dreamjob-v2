"""Collection hands its vacancies to the ranked list, in full (FR-261, FR-166).

Two defects are pinned here, and they compounded into one symptom: an account
with 42,883 collected vacancies and an Opportunities screen reading "0".

* collection ended at the knowledge base.  Synthesis - the pass that turns a
  vacancy row into an opportunity - waited for a button, and the Opportunities
  screen only offers that button once a single campaign is selected, which is
  not the default.  So the ranked list stayed empty and nothing said why;
* ``campaign_vacancies`` capped its pool at 5,000 rows, so even once synthesis
  did run, a long collection was silently truncated to the newest eighth of
  itself.
