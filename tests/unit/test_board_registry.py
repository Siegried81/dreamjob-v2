"""The ATS board registry: the seed file, the importer, and the liveness table.

The registry is how a campaign gets from "no targets" to 7,500 companies
(N3, docs/Data_Gathering_Plan.md section 5.2).  Four things can go wrong with
it quietly, and each has a test here that makes the failure visible:

* **A robots-disallowed fetch inside the product.**  The importer reads the
  Common Crawl URL index, which publishes ``User-agent: * / Disallow: /``.
  It therefore runs outside the egress layer, as an operator-run script, for
  exactly two named hosts - and it still checks robots.txt for every other
  host it touches.  If that ever stops being true, FR-182 stops being an
  invariant and starts being a habit.
* **Junk slugs.**  The Wayback index for ``jobs.ashbyhq.com`` yields 937
  non-slugs among 7,333 strings: ``"..."``, ``".sitemap.xml"``, 400-character
  base64 blobs.  Each one would become a plan item, a 404, a stored
  ``raw_document`` and a re-probe on the next run (section 6.7).
* **A failed import that reports success.**  A run whose sources 500 must not
  write a shorter registry and exit 0; that is the exact shape of defect the
  gathering plan was written to remove (section 3, step 8).
* **A re-import that resets liveness.**  ``last_verified`` belongs to the
  nightly job.  An importer that overwrites it makes every board look
  unverified again and buys the next nightly run 14,600 pointless requests.

Nothing here touches the network: the HTTP tests drive the importer's real
client through an ``httpx.MockTransport``, and the seed tests read the file
committed to the repository.
